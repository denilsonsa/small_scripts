#!/bin/sh

# This is a quick and dirty and very ugly script to set up an ssh tunnel to my
# home network. I use it to listen to my own music collection from my Jellyfin
# instance, without exposing it to whole Internet.

# This script has been anonymized: the usernames and the domain names are
# dummies.

# HOWTO INSTALL instructions:
# * Make several symlinks to this script:
#   ln -s ssh_tunnel_to_my_home_lan.sh xssh_tunnel_to_jellyfin.sh
#   ln -s ssh_tunnel_to_my_home_lan.sh ssh_tunnel_to_jellyfin.sh
#   ln -s ssh_tunnel_to_my_home_lan.sh ssh_tunnel_to_paperless.sh
#   ln -s ssh_tunnel_to_my_home_lan.sh ssh_tunnel_to_homeassistant.sh
